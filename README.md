1) Radhika
2) I want to join WhiteHats because cybersecurity genuinely excites me and keeps me curious to explore more. I have tried some CTF challenges (although I succeeded in only one), I enjoy the thrill of attempting them and the problemsolving mindset they require. Working on these challenges often keeps me awake at night because I truly enjoy figuring things out. I would love to upskill, gain hands-on experience, and learn more about cybersecurity by being part of the WhiteHats community.
3)  The Indian government has made it mandatory for phone companies to pre-install the Sanchar Saathi app to help block stolen phones and prevent fraud, but some companies and privacy experts are concerned because it removes user choice and may affect privacy.
